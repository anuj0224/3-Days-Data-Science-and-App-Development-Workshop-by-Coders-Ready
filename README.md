# About the Workshop 

## Welcome to the "3-Days Data Science and App Development Workshop" by Coders Ready!

Objective: This intensive three-day workshop is designed to equip participants with essential skills in data science and app development. Whether you are a beginner looking to start your journey or an experienced coder seeking to enhance your knowledge, our workshop offers a comprehensive learning experience.

Workshop Highlights:

### Day 1: Advanced Mapping with Cartopy

- Introduction to Cartopy: We started by learning about Cartopy library, a powerful tool for working with geospatial data.
- Mapping Our College: We learned how to geo-reference our college on a map and visualize it using Cartopy.

### Day 2: Advanced Visualization and Mapping

- Analyzation of Satellite Data: We learnt to explore the Satellite Data for creating wonderful visualization maps.
- Digital Elevation Model of Haryana State: We explored how to create a digital elevation model of Haryana state and visualize it for geographical analysis and plot our college on it.

### Day 3: Data Generation and Gaussian Noise for Visualizing Earth's Elliptical Orbit and Curve fitting for Distribution

- Generating Random Data Points: we were taught how to generate random data points using Python.
- Adding Gaussian Noise: We added Gaussian noise to the generated data, simulating real-world data with imperfections.
- Visualizing Earth's Orbit: In a fascinating project, we visualized a makeshift walking orbital path of Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun.
- Fitting with Elliptical Distribution: We fitted the orbital data with an elliptical distribution, demonstrating the versatility of this statistical tool and providing insights into data modeling.

## Libraries and Tools Used

- NumPy: Essential for numerical operations and data manipulation.
- SciPy: Used for scientific and technical computing, including statistical analysis.
- Cartopy: A library for cartographic projections and geospatial data visualization.
- Matplotlib: The go-to library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- Google Colab Notebooks: An interactive environment that allowed students to work on projects and visualize results step by step.
